## GMusic-MPD

Helper script for GMusicProxy together with MPD.
Adds Extended M3U data temporarily to the current playlist

You can use Google Play Music - All Access with the correct extended m3u data using [Music Player Daemon](http://www.musicpd.org/).

This is not limited to GMusicProxy however. It depends on how the m3u data is written.


## [GMusicProxy](http://gmusicproxy.net/)

I'm assuming that you are using this application and have the `--extended-m3u` option set. You can also specify it in your `gmusixproxy.cfg` like this:

```
email=hello@illyism.com
password=password
extended-m3u=true
daemon=true
```

But this tool only interfaces with the saved playlists on the system for the moment. So it doesn't connect with GMusicProxy.

## Usage

Use this tool to load a playlist and grab the m3u data.
And send it to MPD.

You need [Iojs](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) or [Node](https://nodejs.org/). Then install globally with NPM.

```
npm install -g gmusic-mpd
```


```

## Examples

### Set the tags

Done on localhost. Looks at the `/var/lib/mpd/playlists/explosions in the sky.m3u` file and compares the files in the current playlist and adds where it can.

```

gmusic-mpd -d /var/lib/mpd/playlists explosions in the sky

```

### Reload and Play

Connects to the MPD server running on `192.168.1.100` and reloads and plays the first song in the Ratatat playlist.

```

gmusic-mpd -h 192.168.1.100 -d /var/lib/mpd/playlists -r --play ratatat

```


### Fetch a playlist

You can download the playlist by searching for the artist and saving it in the playlists directory. If you specify the reload option it will also load the newly created playlist.

```bash
# Get a playlist for the artist Queen and save it
gmusic-mpd -d /var/lib/mpd/playlists queen -f Queen

# Get a 200 songs playlist and load the 5th track
gmusic-mpd -d /var/lib/mpd/playlists queen -f Queen -r --play 5 --tracks 200

```

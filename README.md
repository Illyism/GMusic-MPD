## GMusic-MPD

Helper script for GMusicProxy together with MPD.
Adds Extended M3U data temporarily to the current playlist

You can use Google Play Music - All Access with the correct extended m3u data using [Music Player Daemon](http://www.musicpd.org/).

This is not limited to GMusicProxy however. It depends on how the m3u data is written.


## [GMusicProxy](http://gmusicproxy.net/)

I'm assuming that you are using this application and have the `--extended-m3u` option set. You can also specify it in your `gmusixproxy.cfg` like this:

```
email=hello@illyism.com
password=password
extended-m3u=true
daemon=true
```

But this tool only interfaces with the saved playlists on the system for the moment. So it doesn't connect with GMusicProxy.

## Usage

Use this tool to load a playlist and grab the m3u data.
And send it to MPD.

You need [Iojs](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) or [Node](https://nodejs.org/). Then install globally with NPM.

```
npm install -g gmusic-mpd
```


```

Usage: gmusic-mpd [options] <playlist>

Options:

  -h, --help                   output usage information
  -V, --version                output the version number
  -d, --directory <directory>  The playlists directory, (ex: ~/.mpd/playlists)
  -e, --ext [extension]        The playlist extension [default: .m3u]

  -l, --list                   Display playlists in directory
  -r, --reload                 Clear and load the playlist
  --play [position]            Play the song in the playlist


```


## Options

> -d --directory

**Always required.** The directory of all the playlist files. Usually this is `~/.mpd/playlists`. Look at your `mpd.conf`.

Default: `.m3u`. The extension of your playlist file.


> -h --host

Default: `localhost`. The hostname or IP of your MPD server.


> -p --port

Default: `6600`. The MPD port.


## Commands

Clear the current playlist completely and load the specified playlist. It doesn't play yet.

## Examples

### Set the tags

Done on localhost. Looks at the `/var/lib/mpd/playlists/explosions in the sky.m3u` file and compares the files in the current playlist and adds where it can.

```

gmusic-mpd -d /var/lib/mpd/playlists explosions in the sky

```

### Reload and Play

Connects to the MPD server running on `192.168.1.100` and reloads and plays the first song in the Ratatat playlist.

```

gmusic-mpd -h 192.168.1.100 -d /var/lib/mpd/playlists -r --play ratatat

```
